This repo serves a way to track the progress I've made through the MiCM Summer Scholars Program.

# Objective



Current papers read:
- ICS chapter from the Comprehensive Biophysics book
- Live-Cell Super-resolution Reveals F-Actin and Plasma Membrane Dynamics at the T Cell Synapse (Ashdown et al.)
- Advances in Image Correlation Spectroscopy: Measuring Number Densities, Aggregation States, and Dynamics of Fluorescently labeled Macromolecules in Cells (Kolin and Wiseman)
- Spatiotemporal Image Correlation Spectroscopy (STICS) Theory, Verification, and Application to Protein Velocity Mapping in Living CHO Cells (Herbert et al.)
- STICS Manual (Pandzic)


Current Work Done:
- Created main app that houses & runs the STICS algorithm
  - Created adjustable tabs & sliders to adjust input parameters
- Created Stack Viewer
  - Added 2 Channel + FOV viewers
  - Added adjustable scaling on the colormap
  - Added various colormap options (e.x parula, jet, cool, etc...)
  - Added automatic adjustment of FOV region as it moves across image
  - Added sliders to control size and x,y position of FOV
  - Added drop-down menu to change FOV color
  - Added speed slider & input box to play through frames
